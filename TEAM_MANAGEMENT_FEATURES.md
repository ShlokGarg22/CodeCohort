2. **Version Control Access** (when repository is locked by creator)
   - Access to project's GitHub repository
   - View commit history and version timeline
   - Compare different versions
   - Navigate to repository directly from navbar

3. **Team Navigation**
   - "My Teams" dropdown in navbar
   - Quick access to joined projects
   - Direct links to project boards and repositories

#### Access Permissions Matrix

## Implementation Details

### Backend Enhancements

```

- `updateMemberRole`: Update team member role (developer/lead)
- Enhanced access control checks

#### Updated Models
- **User Model**: Added 'lead' role to enum
- **Problem Model**: Added 'lead' role to team member enum

### Frontend Enhancements

#### New Components
1. **TeamManagement.jsx**: Comprehensive team management interface
2. **useProjectAccess.js**: Hook for checking project access permissions

#### Enhanced Components
- **CreatorDashboard**: Added team management section
- **ProjectBoard**: Enhanced with role-based access indicators
- **VersionHistory**: Added access control and team member indicators
- **Header**: Enhanced team navigation with repository and version history links

#### Access Control Features
- Role-based UI rendering
- Permission-based feature access
- Real-time access validation
- Intuitive access indicators

## User Experience Flow

### For Creators
1. **Create Project** → Set up repository → Lock repository for team access
2. **Receive Join Requests** → Review and approve developers
3. **Manage Team** → Assign roles, remove members, monitor progress
4. **Control Access** → Lock/unlock repository access as needed

### For Developers
1. **Request to Join** → Send join request with message
2. **Get Approved** → Receive real-time notification
3. **Access Unlocked** → See "My Teams" in navbar
4. **Collaborate** → Access Kanban board, repository, and version history
5. **Contribute** → Work on assigned tasks, view project progress

## Security Considerations

### Access Validation
- Server-side permission checks on all endpoints
- Client-side access control hooks
- Real-time access validation
- Protected routes for sensitive operations

### Repository Access
- Repository access only when explicitly locked by creator
- Team membership validation for repository features
- Secure GitHub integration

### Role-Based Permissions
- Hierarchical permission system
- Minimal privilege principle
- Clear role definitions and boundaries

## Testing the Features

### Creator Testing
1. Create a project and link a GitHub repository
2. Lock the repository from Creator Dashboard
3. Approve team join requests
4. Test team management features (promote to lead, remove members)

### Developer Testing
1. Join a project team
2. Verify access to Kanban board
3. Check "My Teams" navigation
4. Access repository and version history (if locked)
5. Test task management within assigned scope

### Access Control Testing
1. Verify non-members cannot access protected features
2. Test role-based feature availability
3. Confirm repository access is properly gated
4. Validate permission boundaries

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Team communication features
- Advanced role customization
- Project analytics for creators
- Team performance metrics
- Integration with more version control systems

### Scalability Considerations
- Optimized team member queries
- Cached access permissions
- Efficient role-based rendering
- Performance monitoring for large teams
